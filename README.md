## About dataset
The dataset contains Riyadh real estate collected from AQAR in June 2022 by Reema Abuthnain.

The dataset contains 51845 rows and 31 features. The following are the features:Â 
front                    
bedrooms                 
livingrooms

## ML models
We used three different machine learning algorithms, such as

1- SVM

2- Bayesian Ridge Regression

3- Linear Regression



### insight 

for chart #1
The most expensive house prices were in the north and the lowest prices were in the south
 because there are factors that affected the rise of houses in the north.

chart#2
Most of the houses with a driver's room were in the north, 
and this factor helped raise prices in the north.

chart#3
Most of the houses had 4 to 5 rooms in all areas of Riyadh, which helped raise house prices.

chart#4
Most of the houses in Riyadh have two living rooms and contain a garage, and this affected the prices of houses in Riyadh.

## Conclusion
No strong relationship between price and other features leads to low accuracy.
